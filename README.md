Developed a client-server system for remote arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction,multiplication, division) over a network.
Server: Handles client requests, performs operations, and returns results, using socket programmingand forking for concurrency.
Client: Takes user input (numbers and operator), validates it, and sends to the server, displaying theresult.
Implemented error handling (e.g., division by zero, invalid input) and buffer overflow protection.
Built with C for efficient communication and validation, ensuring reliable and secure data transfer.
